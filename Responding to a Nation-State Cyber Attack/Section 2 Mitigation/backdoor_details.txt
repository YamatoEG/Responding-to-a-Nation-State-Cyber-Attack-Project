1) discovering the rogue username 

after analyzing the log files inside /var/log 
and checked the /etc/passwd file 
with these commands 

$cat /etc/passwd
darklord:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/darklord:/bin/bash

$cat /var/log/sys.log | grep darklord
Feb 26 07:44:32 ubuntu-VirtualBox CRON[940]: (root) CMD (/etc/darklord.sh)

I discoverd the rogue username called : "darklord"

2) Locate the malicious process:
after analyzing the process on the system with this command 

$ps aux 

i found this process 
root       966   963  0 07:44 ?        00:00:00 /tmp/remotesec -k -l 56565

that run from the "/tmp" directory 

3) the non-standard port on it is : 56565
$netsat -antp
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:56565           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -

i killed the process and deleted the rogue user with these commands
$kill -9 966

$sudo userdel darklord
